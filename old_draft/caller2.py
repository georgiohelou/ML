Documents can be hierarchically represented by XML-elements. XML documents are represented and indexed using a bitmap indexing technique. We define the similarity and popularity operations available in bitmap indexes and propose a method for partitioning a XML document set. Furthermore, a 2-dimensional bitmap index is extended to a 3dimensional bitmap index, called BitCube. We define statistical measurements in the BitCube: mean, mode, standard derivation, and correlation coefficient. Based on these measurements, we also define the slice, project, and dice operations on a BitCube. BitCube can be manipulated efficiently and improves the performance of document retrieval. The paper starts from the observation that in the inclusion-based approach to point-free geometry there are serious difficulties in defining points. These difficulties disappear once we reformulate this approach in the framework of continuous multivalued logic. So, a theory of ‚Äògraded inclusion‚Äô is proposed as a counterpart of the usual ‚Äòcrisp inclusion‚Äô of mereology. Again, a second theory is considered in which the graded predicates ‚Äòto be close‚Äô and ‚Äòto be small‚Äô are assumed as primitive. In both cases a suitable notion of abstractive sequence and of equivalence between abstractive sequences enables us to define the points. In the resulting set of points a distance is defined in a natural way and this enables a metrical approach to point-free geometry and therefore to go beyond mereotopology.The general idea is that it is possible to search for mathematical formalizations of the naive theory of the space an ordinary man needs to have in its everyday life. To do this we have to direct our attention not only to regions and the related relation of inclusion as it is usual in point-free geometry, but also to those (vague) properties which are geometrical in nature.This contribution describes an approach to integrate a speech understanding and dialog system into a homogeneous architecture based on semantic networks. The definition of the network as well as its use in speech understanding is described briefly. A scoring function for word hypotheses meeting the requirements of a graph search algorithm is presented. The main steps of the linguistic analysis, i.e. syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, are described and their realization in the semantic network is shown. The processing steps alternating between data- and model-driven phases are outlined using an example sentence which demonstrates a tight interaction between word recognition and linguistic processing. Cleaneval is a shared task and competitive evaluation on the topic of cleaning arbitrary web pages, with the goal of preparing web data for use as a corpus for linguistic and language technology research and development. The first exercise took place in 2007. We describe how it was set up, results, and lessons learnt.")
